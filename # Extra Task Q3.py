It is mutable	
The implication of iterations is time-consuming in the list.	
Operations like insertion and deletion are better performed.	
Consumes more memory.	
Many built-in methods are available.	
Unexpected errors and changes can easily occur in lists.
 



Tuple
It is immutable
Implications of iterations are much faster in tuples.
Elements can be accessed better.
Consumes less memory.
Does not have many built-in methods.
Unexpected errors and changes rarely occur in tuples.
